  <p>   Net Neutrality is a big thing. It means that internet users can browse the internet freely without being throttled or such by the ISP (Internet Service Provider.) But now, with Donald J. Trump as the president, that might all change. There is a bill that may be passed that will revoke these laws
      from 2015. That means that ISPs like Comcast or ATT will be able to censor or throttle your internet speeds. Internet is a free will, and having it blocked is like only being able to breathe certain air, or being able to eat certain foods. It's almost like an internet tax. They will also be able to see
      what we are doing on the internet as well, stuff that most people would like hidden. Congress is the only group that can save the internet, but only if we write and call them repeatedly, and fast. Time is running out to December 14, when the law will be decided. The republican-dominated Congress is expected to pass this unconstitutional law, but we must stop it.
      Think about it. This violates the First Amendment. It says that people have free will and speech, but ISPs blocking certain parts of your internet is not giving you free will or speech. 
      ISPs could also make websites pay hundreds of thousands or more to get out of the "throttled" zone, as well as block others completely until they "pay up." ISPs will take over the internet and everything on it UNLESS we react. Visit https://www.battleforthenet.com/ to help. Spread these links, and thank you for caring about our internet and our free will. 
        Secondly, people against net neutrality say that taking it would make the internet "less toxic" and "more controlled." But, is that really true? No. The ISPs don't care how mean users are to other users. Look. They will start bullying websites to pay them money! Why would they care about puny humans bullying others on their internet? (Spoiler: They don't.) 
      They also argue that blocking you from the internet if you have a powerful computer and overuse your data would help the "bandwidth fight" and stop internet in the area from slowing. However, although this is a decent argument from the dark side, it's not right. Although this is true, ISPs will still track and manipulate your data like said in above paragraph. 
      They could just be a little less greedy (tbh) and actually be nice to those people, instead of talking about "banning internet" for them. Come on!
      Startups will also be messed up by this crap they call a bill. "You can't pay up? Then you're absolutely freaking screwed, cause we just want money and are spoiled 6-year olds." People's internet bills will also go up. The charges will increase. ISPs will lower speeds for people who paid higher, and act innocent like the Taylor Swift of internet. (No offense, Reputation lovers.) 
      The internet will become a big mess, like the dirty water nobody wants to drink but everybody has to to stay alive. And you're paying overwhelming prices for it, just because a freaking unconstitutional law was passed. Do it right. Vote for net neutrality and help us save the internet.
