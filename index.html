  <p>Net Neutrality is a big thing. It means that internet users can browse the internet freely without being throttled or such by the ISP (Internet Service Provider.) But now, with Donald J. Trump as the president, that might all change. There is a bill that may be passed that will revoke these laws
      from 2015. That means that ISPs like Comcast or ATT will be able to censor or throttle your internet speeds. Internet is a free will, and having it blocked is like only being able to breathe certain air, or being able to eat certain foods. It's almost like an internet tax. They will also be able to see
      what we are doing on the internet as well, stuff that most people would like hidden. Congress is the only group that can save the internet, but only if we write and call them repeatedly, and fast. Time is running out to December 14, when the law will be decided. The republican-dominated Congress is expected to pass this unconstitutional law, but we must stop it.
      Think about it. This violates the First Amendment. It says that people have free will and speech, but ISPs blocking certain parts of your internet is not giving you free will or speech. 
      ISPs could also make websites pay hundreds of thousands or more to get out of the "throttled" zone, as well as block others completely until they "pay up." ISPs will take over the internet and everything on it UNLESS we react. Visit https://www.battleforthenet.com/ to help.
